No. DoPT-1667555281194 dated 02.08.2022, read with the NITSER Act & Statutes, as amended from time to time. S. No. Post Pay Level No. of vacancies 1. Lab Attendant Pay Level 1 of 7th CPC (18,000-56,900) 2 *The educational qualifications and other eligibility criteria for the post of Lab Attendant will be as per RR (refer Appendix). 2. The object of the Scheme of Compassionate Appointments is to grant appointment on compassionate grounds to a dependent family member of an Institute employee dying in harness or who is retired on medical grounds, thereby leaving his family in penury and without any means of livelihood, to relieve the family of the Government servant concerned from financial destitution and to help it get over the emergency. 3. TO WHOM APPLICABLE: This notification is applicable to the “dependent family member” of the Institute employee who- (a) Dies while in service (including death by suicide); or (b) Is retired on medical grounds under Rule 2 of CCS (Medical Examination) Rules 1957 or the corresponding provision in the Central Civil Service Regulations before attaining the age of 55 years (57 years for erstwhile Group ‘D’ Government servants); or (c) Is retired on medical grounds under Rule 38 of CCS (Pension) Rules, 1972 or the corresponding provision in the Central Civil Service Regulations before Page 2 of 15 \n\nattaining the age of 55 years (57 years for erstwhile Group ‘D’ Government servants). Note: Cases of missing Institute employees are also covered under the Scheme of Compassionate Appointments and the eligible dependents can apply after lapse of at least 2 years from the date from which the employee has been missing provided that an FIR has been lodged with the Police, the missing person is not traceable and the competent authority feels that the case is genuine. ‘Dependent family member’ means: (a) Spouse; OR (b) Son (including adopted son); OR (c) Daughter (including adopted daughter); OR (d) Brother or sister in the case of unmarried Institute employee. ‘Institute employee’ for the purpose of this notification means an Institute employee appointed on regular basis and not one working on daily wage or casual or apprentice or ad-hoc or contract or re-employment basis. 4. ELIGIBILITY: (i) The family is indigent and deserves immediate assistance for relief from financial destitution AND (ii) Applicant for compassionate appointment should be eligible and suitable for the post in all respects under the provisions of the relevant Recruitment Rules (refer Appendix). 5. RELAXATIONS: (i) Upper age limit could be relaxed wherever found necessary. The lower age limit should, however, in no case be relaxed below 18 years of age. Note: Age eligibility shall be determined with reference to the date of application and not the date of appointment. Competent Authority shall take a final decision regarding grant of relaxation of upper age limit. (ii) In exceptional circumstances, the Institute may consider recruiting persons not immediately meeting the minimum educational standards. The Institute may engage them as trainees who will be given the regular pay bands and grade pay only on acquiring the minimum qualification prescribed under the recruitment rules. The emoluments of these trainees, during the period of their training and before they are absorbed in the Institute as employees, will be equal to the lowest/ first cell (minimum) of Pay Level-1 Rs.18,000-56,900 (pre- revised -1S pay band). In addition, they will be granted all applicable allowance Page 3 of 15 \n\nlike the Dearness Allowance, House Rent Allowance and Transport Allowance at the admissible rates. The same shall be calculated on the minimum of Pay Level-1. The period spent in Pay Level-1 by the future recruits will not be counted as service for any purpose as their regular service will start only after they are appointed in the Group ‘C’ post after acquiring minimum educational qualifications. 6.

To update participants on the advanced methods for emission mitigation. To enable participants to understand the methods for preparation of biofuels. To enable participants to analyze the combustion process using numerical techniques. To update participants on new combustion devices like micro-combustor. Combustion is one of the most basic processes which release the chemical energy of fuels for further utilization in many prime movers and power industries. Therefore, combustion methods and strategies has been a topic of intense research for centuries. The difference in the mode and pattern of combustion for different applications make the topic much wider and versatile. Latest studies in Combustion focuses on the development of new fuels and efficient combustion with reduced emission. Combustion is the mode of energy release in prime movers such as automotive internal combustion (IC) engine, Rocket motors, Gas turbine, etc. Recent advancements in internal combustion (IC) engine combustion technology focus heavily on utilizing \"new fuels\" like hydrogen, biodiesel, and natural gas, alongside innovations in combustion strategies like Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) and direct injection. Studies also aim to significantly reduce the emissions while maintaining engine performance and efficiency. Combustion studies in rocket motors are important for proper and efficient energy generation using solid and liquid propellants. Devices such as micro-combustors are also gaining importance as sources of energy for various applications. There is a need to develop new sustainable energy sources which can meet the increased demand, while also addressing the greenhouse gas emissions. Hydrogen is a viable source for meeting this high energy demand and can be used as fuel for internal combustion engines. Preparation of biofuels suitable for IC engines is also of much importance in the current global scenario.\n\nNumerical modelling of Combustion Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) Emission mitigation in IC engines Biodiesel Hydrogen as fuel Solid propulsion in missiles Micro combustors Demo and experiments National Institute of Technology Warangal, was established in 1959. Over the years it has developed into a premier institute of higher learning and is ranked among the top technical education institutions in India.
